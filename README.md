Problem Statement

  In Japan, there are four major categories of ice cream type products:
  
    ● an ice cream type product with at least 15 percent milk solids and at least 8 percent milk fat is called an ice cream;
    
    ● an ice cream type product with at least 10 percent milk solids and at least 3 percent milk fat that is not an ice cream is called an ice milk;
    
    ● an ice cream type product with at least 3 percent milk solids that is not an ice cream or an ice mild is called a lacto ice ;
    
    ● an ice cream type product that is not an ice cream, an ice milk, or a lacto ice is called a flavored ice. 


  
  Here, milk solids consist of milk fat and milk solids-not-at.
  
  AtCoder’s famous product Snuke Ice contains A percent milk solids-not-fat and B percent milk fat.
  
  Which of the categories above does Snuke Ice fall into?
